# word_processing
I did this small project mainly as part of a SPICED academy bootcamp tutorial to get understanding of pytest and continious integration (CI). 
As such it didnt matter which code or function I used. So, i supplied a small function to count words in a given text. 
Several tests were carried out and the function passed them all. The function was pushed to github for CI.
